# Member Equity System Development Plan

## Executive Summary

The Member Equity Management System requires significant work to become production-ready. Based on comprehensive analysis, we recommend a **Vertical Slice Strategy** that delivers complete features incrementally while establishing proper architectural patterns.

## Current State Assessment

### Critical Issues
1. **Frontend relies entirely on mock data** - No backend integration
2. **Zero test coverage** - High risk for financial calculations
3. **Security vulnerabilities** - Hardcoded secrets, mock authentication
4. **Incomplete event sourcing** - Critical for audit trails
5. **Missing core services** - Documents, notifications, analytics

### Assets
- Well-structured frontend UI (complete but disconnected)
- Good architectural foundation (NestJS, Prisma, Event Sourcing)
- Clear module boundaries
- TypeScript throughout

## Recommended Approach: Vertical Slice Strategy

### Why Vertical Slice?
- Delivers working features quickly (1-2 weeks per module)
- Establishes patterns that scale across modules
- Balances technical debt prevention with visible progress
- Allows early validation of architectural decisions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Members Module (Weeks 1-2)

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Write unit tests (minimum 80% coverage)

#### Week 2: Frontend Integration
- [ ] Replace `useMockMembersData` with API calls

- [ ] Complete search, filter, and pagination
- [ ] Test Excel upload functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests

### Phase 2: Equity Module (Week 3)

- [ ] Implement equity history tracking
- [ ] Add equity validation rules
- [ ] Connect frontend equity pages
- [ ] Implement equity reconciliation features
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests

### Phase 3: Distributions Module (Week 4)
**Goal**: Enable profit distribution calculations

- [ ] Add distribution history views
- [ ] Ensure accurate tax withholding calculations

### Phase 4: Core Infrastructure (Week 5)
**Goal**: Complete cross-cutting concerns

- [ ] Complete Auth0 integration
- [ ] Implement notification system (SendGrid)
- [ ] Add document generation (PDF for K-1 forms)
- [ ] Set up S3 integration for document storage
- [ ] Implement background job processing
- [ ] Add system-wide error logging

### Phase 5: Analytics & Reporting (Week 6)
**Goal**: Enable business intelligence features

- [ ] Implement analytics aggregations
- [ ] Add predictive insights
- [ ] Create financial reports
- [ ] Implement data export features
- [ ] Add dashboard real-time updates
- [ ] Performance optimization with caching

### Phase 6: Production Hardening (Week 7)
**Goal**: Prepare for deployment

- [ ] Security audit and fixes
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add monitoring (Sentry integration)
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Disaster recovery setup

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```typescript
// Always use Decimal.js for financial calculations
import { Decimal } from 'decimal.js';

// Example: Distribution calculation
const memberShare = new Decimal(totalAmount)
  .mul(member.equityPercentage)
  .div(100)
  .toFixed(2);
```

### Event Sourcing Pattern
```typescript
// Every state change must emit an event
async updateEquity(memberId: string, newPercentage: number) {
  // 1. Validate
  await this.validateEquityChange(memberId, newPercentage);
  
  // 2. Create event
  const event = new MemberEquityUpdatedEvent({
    memberId,
    previousPercentage: currentPercentage,
    newPercentage,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
  
  // 3. Store event
  await this.eventStore.save(event);
  
  // 4. Update projection
  await this.updateMemberProjection(memberId, newPercentage);
  
  // 5. Publish for real-time updates
  this.eventBus.publish(event);
}
```

### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Replace mock hooks with API calls
// Before:
const { members } = useMockMembersData();

// After:
const { data: members, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['members', fiscalYear],
  queryFn: () => memberApi.getMembersForYear(fiscalYear)
});
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Event Sourcing Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start simple, add complexity gradually
   - Have clear event schemas from the start

2. **Data Migration**
   - Mitigation: Build migration scripts early
   - Test with production-like data volumes

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Implement caching from the start
   - Use database indexes appropriately

### Process Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict module boundaries
   - Weekly stakeholder reviews

2. **Knowledge Gaps**
   - Mitigation: Pair programming
   - Document patterns extensively

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Test coverage > 80% for business logic
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Business KPIs
- Complete feature every 1-2 weeks
- Zero financial calculation errors
- 100% audit trail coverage
- Stakeholder satisfaction score > 8/10

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Run migrations
cd backend && npm run migrate

# Seed initial data
npm run seed
```

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement backend with tests
3. Implement frontend with tests
4. Integration testing
5. Code review
6. Merge to main

## Module Priority Order

1. **Members** - Foundation for all other modules
2. **Equity** - Core business logic
3. **Distributions** - Revenue generation feature
4. **Analytics** - Business insights
5. **Documents** - Compliance requirement
6. **Audit** - Regulatory requirement

## Contingency Plans

### If Behind Schedule
- Prioritize Members + Distributions (MVP)
- Defer Analytics and advanced features
- Consider bringing in additional developers

### If Technical Blockers
- Fallback to simpler event store if needed
- Use managed services (e.g., Auth0 for all auth)
- Leverage more third-party solutions

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions** (Today)
   - Set up development environment
   - Review and understand Members module
   - Create first backend endpoint

2. **This Week**
   - Complete Members backend
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Document patterns for team

3. **Next Week**
   - Integrate Members frontend
   - Start Equity module
   - Daily progress reviews

## Appendix: Technology Stack

### Backend
- NestJS + TypeScript

- Redis (caching + queues)
- JWT + Auth0
- Socket.io
- Bull (job queues)
