## Recommended Reading Order

1. **Start with DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md** - Understand the overall strategy
2. **Then read CODE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md** - Know what needs fixing
3. **Finally use QUICK_START_VERTICAL_SLICE.md** - Begin implementation

## Key Recommendations Summary

### Approach: Vertical Slice Strategy ✅
- **NOT page-by-page** ❌ - This would accumulate technical debt
- **NOT infrastructure-first** ❌ - This delays visible progress
- **YES vertical slices** ✅ - Complete features end-to-end

### Priority Order
1. **Members Module** (Week 1-2) - Foundation with all patterns
2. **Equity Module** (Week 3) - Core business logic
3. **Distributions** (Week 4) - Revenue features
4. **Infrastructure** (Week 5) - Cross-cutting concerns
5. **Analytics** (Week 6) - Business insights
6. **Production Hardening** (Week 7) - Security & performance

### Critical Issues to Address First
1. 🔒 **Replace mock authentication** with real JWT/Auth0
2. 📊 **Complete backend APIs** (currently using mock data)
3. 💰 **Use Decimal.js** for all financial calculations
4. 📝 **Implement event sourcing** for audit trails
5. ✅ **Add comprehensive tests** (currently 0% coverage)

## Next Steps
1. Set up your development environment
2. Start with the Members module following the Quick Start guide
3. Track progress using the Development Plan milestones

Good luck with the implementation! 🚀
